    <h1><a href="..">Corona</a> Facts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Since 1998, Corona Extra is the top-selling imported drink in the United States.</li>
      <li>According to Sinebrychoff, a Finnish company owned by the Carlsberg Group, Corona Extra contains barley malt, corn, hops, yeast, antioxidants (ascorbic acid), and propylene glycol alginate as a stabilizer.</li>
      <li>In Spain, the beer is branded as Coronita (literally, 'little crown'), as renowned winemaker Bodegas Torres has owned the trademark for "Coronas" since 1907.</li>
      <li>Corona was a longtime sponsor of boxing in Mexico, including sponsorship of Saturday night fights on Televisa, but reduced its sponsorship after Anheuser-Busch InBev took full control of the brand.</li>
      <li>Although Corona has seen a loss of $170 million amid the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak, they have ascribed this to a reduction in the numbers of people in China going out, and not to confusion between the beer and the virus.</li>
