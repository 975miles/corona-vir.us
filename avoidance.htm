      Those pesky chinese - invading our country and our bodies. Stay with your own kind, wontcha?
      <br> <br>
      If you do happen to come in close contact with a chinese person (within a 10 mile radius), your options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execution of the foreigner</li>
      <li>Suicide, to prevent the symptoms of coronavirus, because, let's face it, you're already infected</li>
      <li>Quarantining the entire country until it's rid of filthy foreigners</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these methods have been tested, and the results were... definitely results.
      <br> <br>
      I've asked the Prime Minister whether we can become a closed country, y'know, to keep it pure, but I was arrested by some stupid police officers. I'll talk to him again sometime, I know Buddy Boris will listen.
